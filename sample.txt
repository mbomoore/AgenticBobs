Okay, look—what I do is, I take the specs, right? They come in from a customer or a manager or, I don’t know, the fax machine that hates me, and I get them—well, sometimes my assistant gets them—and I read the thing so it doesn’t sound like a ransom note. Then I, uh, make it into something the software folks can actually use, because customers say “make it better” and that could mean a hundred different things, and if you hand that straight to the coders you either get nothing or you get a spaceship when we needed a skateboard. So I call the customer, politely, and I ask the annoying questions—what happens if it breaks, which screen do you mean, that kind of thing—and I write it down plain. Then I bring it to the team—sometimes literally walk it over, yes—and I explain what the human meant, not just what the email said. They ask me nerd questions back, I turn those into English, I take it to the customer so nobody freaks out. If someone goes quiet, I poke them; if someone drags their feet, I poke them too. When the first version shows up, I check it against what we said we’d do, and I get the yes, or I send it back nicely so we don’t have a riot. That’s the job. I keep the talking straight so the doing gets done. I have people skills—real ones—and that’s why the whole thing doesn’t fall apart.
